# Mapping ISO 27001 to Modern Software Engineering

In today's increasingly complex digital landscape, security is no longer an afterthought but a foundational pillar of software engineering. Achieving ISO 27001 certification has become essential for many organizations striving to build trust, minimize risks, and ensure regulatory compliance. In this talk, we will explore why this certification is so crucial for software companies and delve into the specifics of ISO 27001 controls (especially clause A.8) that focus on secure development. We will map these security requirements onto a modern Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), highlighting practical approaches that integrate nicely with agile frameworks and DevOps principles.

Furthermore, we will explore a range of tools, such as static analysis software, dependency scanners, automated deployment checks and many more to effectively meet ISO standards. We will also discuss how to adopt and integrate OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) into the development process as a way to continuously assess and improve the security posture of your projects, ensuring that security becomes a continuous, iterative effort within your teams and your organization.
